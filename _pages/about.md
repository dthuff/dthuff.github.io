# Hi! I'm Daniel. 
This is a WIP while I figure out how to use github sites :)

I got my PhD in Medical Physics in 2022 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I applied computer vision techniques to medical images (mostly PET/CT).

Now, I'm a research scientist for [AIQ Solutions](https://www.aiq-solutions.com/) where I work on a variety of detection, segmentation, and registration problems in the context of medical imaging.

When I'm not at a computer, I might be backpacking, gardening, or telling a cat to *please* get down off the counter.
